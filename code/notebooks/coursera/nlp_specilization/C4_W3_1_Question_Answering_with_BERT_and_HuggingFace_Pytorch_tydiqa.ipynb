Transformers have become the standard model for NLP, similar to convolutional models in computer vision. And all started with Attention!\n","\n","In practice, you'll rarely train a transformer model from scratch.  Transformers tend to be very large, so they take time, money, and lots of data to train fully. Instead, you'll want to start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune it with your dataset if you need to.\n","\n","[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (ðŸ¤—) is the best resource for pre-trained transformers.

All these are packaged together into an easy-to-use object.

For example, `transformers` provides a pipeline for [question answering](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html#the-pipeline-abstraction) that you can directly use to answer your questions if you give some context.
