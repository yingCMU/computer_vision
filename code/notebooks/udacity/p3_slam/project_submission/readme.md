[Github](https://github.com/udacity/P3_Implement_SLAM) : In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! Youâ€™ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.

- only Notebook 3 and the robot_class.py file will be graded: [rubic](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1428/view)
